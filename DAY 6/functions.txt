returntype functionName (parameter lists) {  function is declared in this line
   body of the function
}


return type for returning anything else use void if we dont want to return anything

=====================

functions is of 2 types:

1. standard library functions  = from header files such as printf, scanf

2. user defined functions  = declared by users such as max function performed in maxfunction.cpp

=====================

pointers:

1. address in c: scanf("%d", &var)
2. address is declared using &
3. address changes whenever it compiles again

to overcome this,

int    *ip;    /* pointer to an integer */
double *dp;    /* pointer to a double */
float  *fp;    /* pointer to a float */
char   *ch     /* pointer to a character */
